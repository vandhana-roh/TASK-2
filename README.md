DURATION: 6 WEEKS

DESCRIPTION: This Python script is a simple web vulnerability scanner designed to detect common security flaws—specifically **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**—in web applications. It works by parsing a target URL to extract all HTML forms, then automatically injecting malicious payloads into form fields to test how the server responds. If the server returns specific SQL error messages or reflects script payloads directly in the response, the script flags the form as vulnerable. This helps developers or security analysts identify insecure input handling that could be exploited by attackers. It's an important tool for basic security testing and raising awareness about the need for proper input validation and output sanitization in web applications.
